# 02-governance Layer

The governance layer implements account-level governance controls including cost management, compliance monitoring, and IAM policies. This layer provides the foundation for operational governance and cost optimization across the workload account.

## Design Rationale

### Account-Level Governance

The governance layer focuses on **account-specific governance controls** that complement organization-level policies. This design provides:

- **Cost Visibility**: Budget alerts and cost tracking at the account level
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Account-specific Config rules (when Config is enabled at org level)
- **IAM Governance**: Account-specific IAM roles and policies for governance operations
- **Flexibility**: Can be customized per account while maintaining consistency

### Separation of Concerns

Governance is separated from infrastructure to:

- **Enable Independent Updates**: Governance policies can be updated without affecting infrastructure
- **Clear Ownership**: Governance team can manage this layer independently
- **Compliance Tracking**: Clear separation for audit and compliance purposes

### Budget Management

AWS Budgets provides proactive cost management:

- **Monthly Budgets**: Track spending against monthly limits
- **Multi-Threshold Alerts**: Notifications at 80% and 100% of budget
- **Forecast Alerts**: Early warning when spending is projected to exceed budget
- **Email Notifications**: Direct alerts to stakeholders

### Config Rules (Optional)

Account-specific Config rules can be enabled when AWS Config is enabled at the organization level. These rules enforce:

- **Tagging Compliance**: Required tags on resources
- **Security Standards**: Account-specific security requirements
- **Resource Configuration**: Compliance with organizational standards

## Resources

### AWS Budgets

- **Monthly Cost Budget**: Tracks monthly spending
  - Configurable budget amount per environment
  - Email notifications at 80% and 100% thresholds
  - Forecast-based alerts for proactive management

### AWS Config Rules (Optional)

- **Required Tags Rule**: Ensures resources have required tags
  - Enforces organizational tagging standards
  - Scoped to specific resource types (EC2, RDS, S3, EKS)
  - Configurable tag requirements

### IAM Roles and Policies

- **Budget Administrator Role** (optional): For budget management operations
- **Budget Viewer Policy** (optional): Read-only access to budget information

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. Bootstrap layer deployed (S3 state bucket and KMS key must exist)
2. `common.auto.tfvars` configured at repository root
3. `backend-config.hcl` generated by the bootstrap script

### Configuration

Configure budget settings in environment-specific configuration:

```hcl
budget_amount = 1000  # Monthly budget in USD
budget_contact_emails = ["admin@example.com"]
```

### Deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh governance <environment>
```

**Environments**: `dev`, `test`, `prod`, `sbx`

**Options**:
- `--auto-approve`: Skip interactive confirmation
- `--skip-plan`: Skip the plan step and apply directly

### Post-Deployment

After deployment, verify:

1. Budget is created and active in AWS Budgets console
2. Email notifications are configured correctly
3. Config rules (if enabled) are active and compliant

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `budget_name` | Name of the monthly budget |
| `budget_arn` | ARN of the monthly budget |
| `aws_region` | AWS region where resources are deployed |
| `aws_account_id` | AWS account ID |

## Notes

### AWS Config Service

The AWS Config service itself should be enabled at the **organization/landing zone level**, not in workload accounts. This layer provides account-specific Config rules that work with the organization-level Config service.

### Budget Configuration

Budgets are configured per environment. Production environments typically have higher budgets than development or sandbox environments. Budget amounts should be reviewed and updated regularly based on actual spending patterns.
